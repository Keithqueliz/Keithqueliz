I’m currently a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, with a focus on Data Science and Machine 
Learning. I enjoy using data and algorithms to solve complex problems and exploring how technology can improve our 
lives. I’ve worked on projects that combine my passion for finance and programming, such as algorithmic trading and 
data analysis
